Campus Card Balance
===================

Campus Card Balance is an Android app that displays the remaining balance on a [Carleton University](http://www.carleton.ca) Campus Card. That's it. 

###Security###
Because Carleton Central does not have a public API, you must enter your student ID and PIN number for this app to work. We don't read, store, or care about your student ID or PIN number.  But be careful; it is possible for someone with access to your phone to obtain your PIN number.
